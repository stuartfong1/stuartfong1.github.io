                    I am an aspiring software engineer located in Milton, Ontario.
                    I am currently a high school student interested in the field of computer science,
                    where I am enrolled in the Extended French program and the
                    Information & Communications Technology Specialist High Skills Major (ICT SHSM)

                    I work as a Senior Assistant Instructor @ <a href="https://robo-geek.ca">Robo-Geek Inc.</a>,
                    where I teach students of ages 7-15 about coding and robotics.

                    During my spare time, I work on personal projects that interest me.

                        It is a robot that is uses line detection to navigate along a path. 
                        It uses a Raspberry Pi to get the camera input, 
                        an Arduino to control the motors for the wheels,
                        and Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) to communicate between the two.
                        It also uses Robotic Operating System (ROS) to view the robot's camera 
                        from a remote laptop.
